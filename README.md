# wgs84_ch1903.py

This script is used to convert WGS84 coordinates to CH1903/LV03 or vice versa.

The original file is not available anymore on the [swisstopo website](http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/software/products/skripts.html).

That's why this repository was created to archive the Python script `wgs84_ch1903.py`.
